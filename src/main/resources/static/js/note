this project stoped at the point that previous front router.js didnot load the dynamic content of loaded page i.e js 
in this one i follow a different appproch header and footer to be inject in each html plage and using them i cal call the controllers which retuurn html pages with their css and js 
that rendered fine 
in the next approch i will try to make a welcome screenwithout a major dynamic content with only header and footer and use controllers to load the full pages


the issue here when login and controller return index .html it did not show header and footer and the css is not properly adjusted 
how ever when load /index controller it return the page fine with header and footer loaded also with js and css loaded and work fine

--here we added webconfig class for resource handling using this i can write the url like
http://192.168.101.20:8089/oracleUsr/css/searchuser.css before resouce handwler the spring was recognize the url as controller 
--we also use and add jquery library to js folder to handle login form logic 
also we can use background imagew as url will be http://192.168.101.20:8089/oracleUsr/images/login.png
